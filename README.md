In the "Dicee" game, two players roll dice to determine the winner based on the higher number rolled in each round. Game uses the DOM to dynamically update dice images and scores based on JavaScript logic.


A web-based dice game called "Dicee", where two players roll dice to determine the winner based on the higher number rolled. The HTML structure features a container div encompassing the game's main content, which includes two dice divs representing Player 1 and Player 2. Each dice div contains a text label identifying the player and an image displaying a dice face initially set to "dice6.png", suggesting they represent standard six-sided dice. The document also includes a heading "Refresh Me" and a footer crediting the page's creator. The accompanying CSS stylesheet likely enhances the visual presentation with styles for the container, dice divs, and text elements, possibly incorporating custom fonts from the Google Fonts API. The JavaScript file "index.js" adds interactivity to the game by simulating dice rolls, comparing rolled values, determining round winners, and updating displayed dice images
